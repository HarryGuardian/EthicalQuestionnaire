				<h5>Abstract</h5>
				<p>Within the Computer Science community, many ethical issues have emerged as significant and critical concerns.
					Computer ethics is an academic field in its own right and there are unique ethical issues associated with information technology.
					It encompasses a range of issues and concerns including privacy and agency around personal information,
					Artificial Intelligence and pervasive technology, the Internet of Things and surveillance applications.
					As computing technology impacts society at an ever growing pace,
					there are growing calls for more computer ethics content to be included in Computer Science curricula.
					In this paper we present the results of a survey that polled faculty from Computer Science and related disciplines about
					teaching practices for computer ethics at their institutions.
					The survey was completed by respondents from 61 universities across 23 European countries.
					Participants were surveyed on whether or not computer ethics is taught to Computer Science students at each institution,
					the reasons why computer ethics is or is not taught, how computer ethics is taught,
					the background of staff who teach computer ethics and the scope of computer ethics curricula.
					This paper presents and discusses the results of the survey.</p>

				<h5>Abstract</h5>
				<p>Portable electronics devices (PEDs) are one of the most promising sources for information-exchange in this Information Age.
					Their performance is becoming very much sensitive to power consumption.
					Rechargeable batteries are the prime source of energy for PEDs and a key to their desired performance stability.
					With the remarkable progress in battery charging technologies and USB standards,
					multifunctional PEDs have constantly been able to meet the requests of our daily life conveniently.
					But these PEDs charge their rechargeable batteries at different voltage and power levels thus each requires a different kind of a battery charger.
					In this paper concept of universal USB charger has been explored i.e a single USB charger for all the PEDs. To realize this universal USB charger first,
					a comprehensive overview of USB standards and specifications has been outlined.
					Next GaN-based active clamp flyback converter has been discussed along with some possible architecture for single-port and multi-port universal chargers.</p>

					<h5>Abstract</h5>
					<p>In the digital economy well known problems take a new shape: planned obsolescence increasingly impacts our everyday life,
						undermining the performances of our smartdevices, from mobilephones, to personal computers, connected cars and smart-homes.
						This shatters the very basis of consumerlaw, challenges its effectiveness, and raises some crucial issues,
						requiring innovative solutions. Addressing the legal implications of such phenomenonhas thus become a necessity
						Current sanctions and the approach of the EU legislator on this point so far showa lack of effectiveness, leaving open some fundamental questions.
						Is actual consumer law fit enoughto tackle planned obsolescence? Can unfair trading law contribute to improving the effectiveness of consume contract law
						 in solving the issue of planned obsolescence? Other major issues concern the growing tension with the goal of achieving sustainable development
						 and a circular economy; ensuring longer durability of consumer goods is indeed crucial for achieving more sustainable consumption behaviour,
						 waste reduction and environmental protection.</p>

							<h4><b>AR Privacy. Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. </b></h4>
							<p>How to Address Privacy Questions Raised by the Expansion of Augmented Reality in Public Spaces.</p>

					<h5>Abstract</h5>
					<p>When new technologies emerge, they often raise new privacy questions and alter privacy norms,
						especially when they change how personal information is collected, stored, and processed.
						These questions can be particularly acute when consumers, businesses,
						and governments bring these technologies into public spaces where competing priorities,
						including public safety, civil liberties, and personal privacy, may collide.
						Augmented reality (AR)—an immersive technology that overlays digitally rendered content on a user’s physical environment—is no exception,
						and the emergence of this technology has the potential to alter both social and legal understandings of privacy and public space.
						AR adoption will likely grow substantially in the coming years. While mobile AR
						(AR applications accessed through a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet)
						has driven the success of this technology to date, wearable AR technologies such as smart glasses are expected to enter the mainstream market in coming years,
						and other applications such as advanced heads-up displays in vehicles are also on the horizon.
						 As AR and other immersive technologies gain more widespread adoption,
						 there will be two sets of important privacy questions: one set about the collection and use of data about AR users,
						 and one set about the collection and use of data about AR bystanders. This report focuses on the latter set of questions.</p>

						<h5>Abstract</h5>
						<p>Our daily digital life is full of algorithmically selected content such as social media feeds,
							recommendations and personalized search results.
							These algorithms have great power to shape users' experiences, yet users are often unaware of their presence.
							Whether it is useful to give users insight into these algorithms'
							existence or functionality and how such insight might affect their experience are open questions.
							To address them, we conducted a user study with 40 Facebook users to examine their perceptions of the Facebook News Feed curation algorithm.
							Surprisingly, more than half of the participants (62.5%) were not aware of the News Feed curation algorithm's existence at all.
							Initial reactions for these previously unaware participants were surprise and anger.
							We developed a system, FeedVis, to reveal the difference between the algorithmically curated and an unadulterated News Feed to users,
							 and used it to study how users perceive this difference. Participants were most upset when close friends and family were not shown in their feeds.
							 We also found participants often attributed missing stories to their friends' decisions to exclude them rather than to Facebook News Feed algorithm.
							 By the end of the study, however, participants were mostly satisfied with the content on their feeds.
							 Following up with participants two to six months after the study, we found that for most,
							 satisfaction levels remained similar before and after becoming aware of the algorithm's presence, however,
							 algorithmic awareness led to more active engagement with Facebook and bolstered overall feelings of control on the site.</p>

						<h5>Abstract</h5>
						<p>With nearly two and a half billion users - a third of the worlds population.
						Facebook for and away hosts the largest speech platform in the history of humanity.
						In the United States, seven out of ten adults use it, and nearly half get news from it.
						It is therefore no exaggeratin to observe that Facebook's self promulgated rules for "what is and is not allowed on Facebook"
						its content based Community standards, rival if not exceed the First Ammendment's importance in shaping discourse in the United States.
						Yet unlike the first ammendment, which only protects against government censorship, no scholarship has scruinized
						the Community stndards' private regulation of speech on Facebook's far-reaching social platform.
						As a result, basic questions about Facebooks's sprawling speech code remain unexamined. For instance,
						at a minimun, do they offer enough clarity to ordinary users and prevent arbitrary or discriminatory moderation?
