		    <h2>The Issues.</h2>
		    <p>How has ever-progressing technology, and anti-consumer practices demanded greater equal ethical consideration?.</p>
				<p>Ever-progressing technologies have become more widespread over the last decade or so. To
					consider these technologies vital to our everyday lives would be no exaggeration. But, have we as a
					society taken enough steps to ensure that any individual within our society is protected from anticonsumer practices and abuse levelled at them from corporations.
					Or, has advertising masked these
					issues. Companies attempt to circumvent the truth far too regularly. Consumer items can endow
					hidden costs at the expense of an individual’s privacy. Have we as software developers, hobbyists
					and users demanded enough change to force the creation of moral and ethical frameworks in regard
					to technology, or have we been swept up by the cascade of devices that promise an ever-increasing
					usefulness.</p>
					<p>Ethical considerations in technology, whether software or hardware, are not necessarily
					considered vital to developers. On occasion, a developer considering ethics within their project will
					be persuaded to ignore ethical considerations and instead focus on profit margins or development
					deadlines. A Research article evaluating the last decade of research from the International Data
					Corporation details as little as 3% of the total 22.3 million software developers and hobbyists belong
					to a professional body (Kawas, S, 2020). This means that there would technically be no authority or
					reason for these developers to adopt moral considerations within their work.</p>
					<p>Of the 3% of software developers that belong to professional bodies, there are an unknown quantity
					who have been instructed by their authority figures to disregard ethical considerations. An Oxford
					Analytica (2021) briefing detailed Big Tech’s, name for large technology corporations, antitrust
					troubles regarding a case where Facebook had acted without moral consideration in regard to their
					users. An example of a hardware development that approached the topic of morality was the recent
					Right-to-repair case. The case detailed Apple Inc. suing a Norwegian phone repair shop (Grinvald,
					L.C. and Tur-Sinai, O., 2019). This sparked debate about the immorality in how Apple viewed its
					consumer base.</p>
					<p>Computer Ethics have now been viewed as an academic field in its own right. Computer ethics
					encompasses privacy issues, artificial intelligence, pervasive technology, the internet of things, and
					surveillance (Stavrakakis, I. 2021). Students of computer sciences will not always learn computer
					ethics. A survey produced by the International Journal of Ethics Education examined how common
					computer ethics was taught in European Universities. 22 responses from 61 countries were received
					from academic institutions that do not teach computer ethics (Stavrakakis, I. 2021). It is the belief of
					the academic computer ethics community, that the importance of computer ethics in education will
					increase as corporations and software developers continue to abuse morality within their
					advancements.</p>

			    <h2>What are the Questionnaires?</h2>
			    <p>The questionnaores are an attempt to guage the level of underastanding from software develpers in academia.</p><br>
					<p>he idea behind this product was due to the lack od consideration outl;ined earlier. In short, there needed to
					be a greater consideration, from software developers, regarding ethical and moral issues within
					computer science. To ascertain the lack of attention to these issues, I propose a questionnaire, in the
					form of a website, which queries on the scope of consideration that software developers and
					hobbyists have levied towards morality within their work..</p><br>
					<p>The questionnaires on the subsequent pages include 15-20+ questions that range across common ethical issues found within computing.
					They have been purposely hand-picked by the authors of the specific questionnaire to guage a level of consideration.
					users can pick a value of consideration from 'Never Considered' to 'Specifically Worked On' and options in between.
					</p><br>
					<p>More questionnaires will arrive on the website. More academic professers, institutions, and students will
					create future questionnaires regarding different ethical topics.
